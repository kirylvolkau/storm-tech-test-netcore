# Solution

## Task 1
Successful run (after running the migration, of course).

## Task 2
As written in the task, I've updated `Details.cshtml` file. However, from my point of view, this is not just a question of presentation, so in the real-life project I would insist on changes either into the `Model` or `Controller` part of MVC pattern.
