# Solution

## Task 1
Successful run (after running the migration, of course).

## Task 2
As written in the task, I've updated `Details.cshtml` file. However, from my point of view, this is not just a question of presentation, so in the real-life project I would insist on changes either into the `Model` or `Controller` part of MVC pattern.

## Task 3
Easy fix - glad we caught it early ðŸ˜…

## Task 4
Easy fix ðŸ’ª

## Task 5
Solution for this one is not as clean as it could be. 
Originally, I'm a backend developer - although I don't mind extending my set of capabilities. So, I required to do some research to complete the task (how to call C# function from JS in ASP.NET and how to re-render in a new location).
Nevertheless, this task solution could be improved - at least without setting the location as a string, since this could be hard to maintain in the future.

## Task 6
Nice extension to make! I would also propose limiting users to edit only lists they have ownership of - now they are able to also edit lists they are not owners of.

## Task 7
For me this task was also mostly about the frontend - unfortunately, I had some time figuring out how to select elements and pass them on in the location string.
